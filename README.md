One of the most frequently used types of digital image forgery is copying one area in the image and
pasting it into another area of the same image. This is known as the copy-move forgery. In this
paper, we present two efficient techniques for Copy-move forgery detection that use image blobs
and key-points to tackle the limits of the existing copy-move forgery detection methods. The first
method is based on image blobs and BRISK feature. The second method is based on image blobs
and AKAZE feature. The two proposed methods utilize the same pipeline, that is image blobs are
found in the image being analyzed, then features are extracted in each blob and the matching process
between features from different blobs is performed. The two proposed methods are implemented and
evaluated on the copy-move forgery standard datasets MICC-F8multi, MICC-F200, and CoMoFoD.

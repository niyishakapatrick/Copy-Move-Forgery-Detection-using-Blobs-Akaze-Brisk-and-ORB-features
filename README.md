To overcome the limits of the existing block-based and keypoint based copy-move forgery detection methods, In
this paper, we present an efficient technique for Copy-move forgery detection that utilizes the image
blobs and keypoints. The proposed method is based on image blobs and BRISK feature. The proposed method is implemented and
evaluated on the copy-move forgery standard datasets MICC-F8multi, MICC-F220 and CoMoFoD.
The experimental results show that the proposed method is effective for geometric transformation,
such as scaling and rotation, and robust when an image is distorted by noise addition, blurring,
brightness change, and jpeg compression.
